<dl>
<dd>4th-century BC &ndash;&nbsp;<a title="Aristotle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&nbsp;publishes&nbsp;<em><a title="Physics (Aristotle)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_(Aristotle)">Physics</a></em>, in which the aether is briefly described as being an element lighter than air that surrounds celestial bodies. He describes the aether in relation to other&nbsp;<a title="Classical element" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element">elements</a>&nbsp;- aether is lighter than air and is located above it, whereas air is lighter than water, and water is lighter than earth. In Aristotle's view, each element returns to its proper place when displaced, which explains why air rises, why earth and water fall, and why the heavens remain in place.</dd>
<dd>1704 &ndash;&nbsp;<a title="Isaac Newton" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a>&nbsp;publishes&nbsp;<em><a title="Opticks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opticks">Opticks</a></em>, in which he proposes a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Particle theory of light" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_theory_of_light">particle theory of light</a>. This had trouble explaining&nbsp;<a title="Diffraction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction">diffraction</a>, so he adds a "fudge factor," claiming that an "Aethereal Medium" is responsible for this effect, and going further to suggest it might be responsible for other physical effects such as&nbsp;<a title="Heat" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat">heat</a>.</dd>
<dd>1727 &ndash;&nbsp;<a title="James Bradley" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bradley">James Bradley</a>&nbsp;measures&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Stellar aberration" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_aberration">stellar aberration</a>&nbsp;for the first time, proving (again) that light has a finite speed as well as that the Earth is moving.</dd>
<dd>1818 &ndash;&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Augustin Fresnel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Fresnel">Augustin Fresnel</a>&nbsp;introduces the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Wave-particle duality" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality">wave theory of light</a>, which proposes light is a transverse wave travelling in an aether, thereby explaining how&nbsp;<a title="Polarization (waves)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)">polarization</a>&nbsp;can exist. It is important to note that both Newton's particle theory and Fresnel's wave theory both assume an aether exists, albeit for different reasons. From this point on, no one even seems to question its existence.</dd>
<dd>1820 &ndash; Discovery of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sim&eacute;on Poisson" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Poisson">Sim&eacute;on Poisson</a>'s "Bright Spot", supporting the Wave Theory.</dd>
<dd>1830 &ndash; Fresnel develops a formula for predicting and measuring aether dragging by massive objects, based on a coupling constant. Such dragging seems to be at odds with aberration however, which would require the Earth&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to drag the aether in order to be visible.

<dd>1851 &ndash;&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Armand Fizeau" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Fizeau">Armand Fizeau</a>&nbsp;carries out his famous experiment with light travelling through moving water. He measures fringing due to motion of the water, perfectly in line with Fresnel's formula. However he sees no effect due to the motion of the Earth, although he does not comment on this. Nevertheless this is seen as very strong evidence for aether dragging.</dd>
<dd>1868 &ndash;&nbsp;<a class="new" title="Martinus Hoek (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Martinus_Hoek&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Martinus Hoek</a>&nbsp;carries out an improved version of Fizeau's using an&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Interferometer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometer">interferometer</a>&nbsp;experiment with one arm in water.
